## Key Learnings
- The model will try to simulate the dynamic behavior of a vehicle under hard braking conditions.
- The model uses a single wheel which can be increased to replicate the no. of times to create a model for multi-wheel vehicle
- Compared the results of braking when ABS is on v/s when ABS is off.
- Without ABS, the vehicle skids about an extra 100 feet and 3 seconds more.
- What are mu-slip curves?
- There is always a delay associated with the hydraulic lines of the brake system
- The equations involved.
