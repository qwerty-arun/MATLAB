# Description
- Uses two models of a bouncing ball to show different approaches to modeling hybrid dynamic systems with Zeno behavior.  </br>
- Zeno behavior is informally characterized by an infinite number of events occurring in a finite time interval for certain hybrid systems. </br>
- As the ball loses energy, the ball collides with the ground in successively smaller intervals of time. </br>
